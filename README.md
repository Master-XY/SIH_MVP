## Project Overview

This project is the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a **SIH Dashboard** designed to help stakeholders (e.g., government agencies, administrators, citizens) visualize and manage real-time data in a user-friendly way. It consists of a frontend dashboard, backend server, and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) modules to collect, process, and serve data.

It’s built modularly:

* **frontend/** – user interface (charts, maps, controls)
* **backend/** – APIs, business logic, authentication
* **etl/** – pipelines to ingest and preprocess raw data

---

## Motivation & Objectives

* Provide real-time insights to decision makers
* Reduce manual effort in data aggregation and reporting
* Enable predictive alerts and trend analysis
* Support transparency and data-driven governance
* Showcase your technical skill and thought process for SIH evaluation

---

## Features

* Dashboard with multiple visualizations (charts, maps, tables)
* Filters, drill-downs, and responsive UI
* User authentication & role-based access control
* Data ingestion pipeline with scheduling / automation
* RESTful APIs to serve processed metrics
* (Optional) Notifications / alerts when thresholds are exceeded

## Architecture & Tech Stack

| Layer / Component   | Technology / Framework                            | Purpose                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Frontend            | [React / Angular / Vue / etc.]                    | UI, visualization, user interactions     |
| Backend             | [Node.js / Django / Flask / FastAPI / etc.]       | Business logic, APIs, data serving       |
| Database            | [PostgreSQL / MySQL / MongoDB / etc.]             | Persistent storage of processed data     |
| ETL / Data pipeline | [Python scripts / Airflow / cron jobs, etc.]      | Fetching, cleaning, aggregating raw data |
| Deployment          | [Docker / Kubernetes / Heroku / AWS / GCP / etc.] | Hosting, containerization, CI/CD         |
| Authentication      | [JWT / OAuth / sessions]                          | Securing endpoints and managing users    |

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

* Git
* [Node.js / Python / whichever runtimes you use]
* Database (e.g. PostgreSQL)
* (Optional) Docker

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Master-XY/SIH_MVP.git
   cd SIH_MVP
   ```

2. **Backend setup**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt   # or npm install etc.
   # Configure database connection settings in config / .env
   # Run migrations if needed
   python manage.py migrate   # or equivalent
   python manage.py runserver  # or equivalent
   ```

3. **ETL / Data ingestion**

   ```bash
   cd ../etl
   # Run pipeline
   python pipeline.py   # or schedule via cron / Airflow
   ```

4. **Frontend setup**

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   npm start  # or the command to run dev server
   ```

5. **Access the system**
   Open browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or the configured port)

## Future Work / Roadmap

Some enhancements I plan to implement beyond the MVP:

* Add machine learning / predictive analytics
* Integrate alerting via email / SMS
* Support more data sources and APIs
* Improve UI/UX, mobile responsiveness
* Role-based dashboards (citizen view, admin view, etc.)
* Performance optimization & scaling
